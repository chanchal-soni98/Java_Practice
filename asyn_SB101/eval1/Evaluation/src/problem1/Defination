Q1. What do you mean by Functional programming and Functional interface?

ans = Functional programming is introduced in Java 8. 

Functions are treated as first class citizens or functions can be treated as a value. We can assign
function to the reference variable or we can pass function to another function's parameter, we can return
function from another functions it is call called as function programming. 
In this mainly we deal with functions.
Functional programming is the combinations of small small function and it created complex function.

At the same it can contain n number of static and n numbers of default methods but only one abstract method must be 
there.
