Q1/- What is the requirement of Java Database communication?
ans - first you must register the driver in your program before you use it. 
Regitering the driver isthe process by which the oracle's class file is loaded into the memory, so it can be utilzed as an implwmentation of the JDBC interfaces. 

Q2/- What is JDBC, Write a note on JDBC driver software.
ans - JDBC stands for java database connectivity is the javasoft specification of a standard programming interface
that allows java programs to access database management systems. 
It provides a standard way to access data using the java programming languages. 
Using JDBC, an application can access a variety of databaese and run on any platform with a java virtual machine.

Q3/- Write a Jdbc application to establish the connection with the Mysql database.
ans - 

create database jdbc;  
use jdbc;  
create table emp(id int(10),name varchar(20),age int(3));

import java.sql.*;  
class Mysql{  
public static void main(String args[]){  
try{  
Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");  
Connection con=DriverManager.getConnection(  
"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/jdbc","root","root");  
 
Statement stmt=con.createStatement();  
ResultSet rs=stmt.executeQuery("select * from emp");  
while(rs.next())  
System.out.println(rs.getInt(1)+"  "+rs.getString(2)+"  "+rs.getString(3));  
con.close();  
}catch(Exception e){ System.out.println(e);}  
}  
}  

Q4/- Write down the responsibilities of the Jdbc Client.
ans - The JDBC API is a Java API that can access any kind of tabular data,
 especially data stored in a relational database. JDBC helps you to write Java applications 

cdthat manage these three programming activities: Connect to a data source, like a database. Send queries and update statements to the database.
