Q2/- What is a Race condition, How will you solve the Race condition,explain with an
Example.
ans .
      A race condition occurs when two threads access a shared variable at the same time. The first thread reads the variable,
      and the second thread reads the same value from the variable.
      The usual solution to avoid race condition is to serialize access to the shared resource. If one process gains access first,
      the resource is "locked" so that other processes have to wait for the resource to become available.

       a race condition can be defined as, a condition in which two or more threads compete together to get certain shared resources.

            For example, if thread A is reading data from the linked list and another thread B is trying to delete the same data.
            This process leads to a race condition that may result in run time error.
