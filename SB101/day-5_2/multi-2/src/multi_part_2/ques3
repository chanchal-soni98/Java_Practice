Q3/- What is the Difference between the sleep and join method explain with one example.
<<<<<<< HEAD

ans . There is a difference between join() and sleep().
      Join() will wait until the timeout expires or the thread finishes. sleep() will just wait for the specified amount of time unless interrupted.
      So it is perfectly possible for join() to return much faster than the specified time.

      The join() method of a Thread instance is used to join the start of a thread’s execution to the end of another thread’s execution such that
      a thread does not start running until another thread ends.

      Causes the currently executing thread to sleep for the specified number of milliseconds,
      subject to the precision and accuracy of system timers and schedulers.
