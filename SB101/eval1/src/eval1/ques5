 It is used to refer methods of functional interface like - static method, nonstatic method and constructor.

 method reference syntax: ObjectName :: methodName;

 1. Static method - by this static method can refer.

 class staticMethod{

 	public static void methodName(){

      //body
 	}
 	staticMethod ::methodName;
 }

 2. nonStatic or instance Method-  in this method reference you can refer nonstatic or instance method.

     ObjectName :: instanceMethodName;

 3.Constructor - If you want to refer constructor, use constructor method reference.

   className :: new;
